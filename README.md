OmidCluster
=====

This project provides scripts to run Omid (https://github.com/yahoo/omid) against a cluster of machines.
The scripts are tested under both Linux and Mac, but sometimes require some manutall attention to make it work.
The purpose is to make it easier for the researchers to run Omid against YCSB (or other) benchmarks.
